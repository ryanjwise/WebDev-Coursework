You're going to love this one: we have updated all ZTM courses to be 2021 ready! That means free updated videos and content for you!! Our goal as instructors at ZTM is to be known for always updated content and material. You can find the updated lecture titles and numbers below for each course. Remember, if you are enrolled in these courses you get the updates for free and we made it so you donâ€™t have to rewatch the entire course, but instead go back and watch the new/updates lectures if you want to stay up to date. Please help us continue to dedicate time to these courses by leaving a review anywhere on the internet about ZTM :grimacing: and help us keep growing!

 Lecture #s only apply to Udemy students, if you are an Academy member :zerobot: you can ignore them!
