    <p>
        With Rue My Heart is Laden<br/>
        <br/>
        For golden friends I had,<br/>
        For many a rose-lipt maiden<br/>
        And many a lightfoot lad.<br/>
        <br/>
        By brooks too broad for leaping<br/>
        The lightfoot boys are laid;<br/>
        The rose-lipt girls are sleeping<br/>
        In fields where roses fade.<br/>
        <br/>
        - AE Houseman
