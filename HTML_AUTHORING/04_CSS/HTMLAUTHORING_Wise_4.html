    <h1>Launceston, Australia</h1>
    <p>
      Launceston is a city in the north of Tasmania, Australia, at the junction
      of the North Esk and South Esk rivers where they become the Tamar River
      (kanamaluka). With a population of 87,328, Launceston is the second most
      populous city in Tasmania after the state capital, Hobart, and the
      fifth-largest inland city in Australia.

    <p>
      Settled by Europeans in March 1806, Launceston is one of Australia's
      oldest cities and it has many historic buildings. Like many places in
      Australia, it was named after a town in the United Kingdom â€“ in this case,
      Launceston, Cornwall. Launceston also had the first use of anaesthetic in
      the Southern Hemisphere, it was the first Australian city to have
      underground sewers, and it was the first Australian city to be lit by
      hydroelectricity. The city has a temperate climate with four distinct
      seasons. Local government is split between the City of Launceston and the
      Meander Valley and West Tamar Councils.
